By default, archive mode is enabled in .env files. To start full node, set BOR_MODE=full

Recommended docker-compose version
```
docker-compose version 1.29.1, build c34c88b2

mkdir -p heimdall/snapshot
mkdir -p heimdall/scripts
mkdir -p bor/snapshot
mv <path-to-heimdall-snapshot-file> heimdall/snapshot
mv <path-to-bor-snapshot-file> bor/snapshot
mv heimdall-startup.sh heimdall/scripts
```

For setting up nodes:
```
docker-compose -f shibarium-sentry-with-snapshotting.yml --env-file <env-file> up
```

If your docker-compose doesn't support `--env-file` flag, then copy mumbai.env/mainnet.env to `.env` and run the following command

For setting up nodes:
```
docker-compose -f shibarium-sentry-with-snapshotting.yml up
